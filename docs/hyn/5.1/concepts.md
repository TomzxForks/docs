# Introduction

The principle of multi tenancy is about a single instance of software running
on a server and serving multiple tenants. The interpretation of such a tenancy
application is quite varied, the possible implementations is even without
boundary.

Hyn tenancy is focused on providing a drop-in solution for Laravel without
sacrificing flexibility or hacks of the Laravel ecosystem.

This packages holds onto one core belief, **the tenant is the website**, thus:

- A tenant is a website;
- A website can have zero or more hostnames;
    - A website is identified when a specific hostname is requested;
- Customers allow for easier grouping;
    - Using customers is optional;
    - A website can belong to a customer;
    - A hostname can belong to a customer.

# Website

You can think of a website as a single mirror of the code base, re-using your default
app code. In addition, it is also possible to have very [tenant specific logic][directory-structure],
for instance custom routes, a vendor folder, or media and language files.

# Hostname

A hostname is a [Fully Qualified Domain Name][fqdn] (for instance sub.example.com).
Your application handles incoming requests to specific hostnames. Tenancy inspects
these requests and [sets up the tenancy environment][identification] according to the
matched hostname or a default fallback.

# Customer

A customer is the binding entity between websites and hostnames. They allow combining
the two freely. A website and hostname can have a customer, they don't need to be
the same by the way.
